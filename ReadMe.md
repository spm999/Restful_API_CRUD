Node.js Express API with MongoDB:
This is a simple Node.js API built using Express.js and MongoDB for managing tasks. You can use this README.md file as a guide to set up and run the application.

Prerequisites:
Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from the official website.

MongoDB: Install and set up MongoDB on your machine or use a cloud-based MongoDB service like MongoDB Atlas.

Visual Studio Code (VSCode): You can use any code editor of your choice, but this guide assumes you are using VSCode.

Getting Started:
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

Install the required Node.js packages by running the following command:


npm install

Create a .env file in the project directory to store your MongoDB connection URI. Add the following line to the .env file, replacing <Username> and <Password> with your MongoDB username and password:

MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<Username>:<Password>@gallary.xducnkc.mongodb.net/Node?retryWrites=true&w=majority
Note: If you prefer not to use a .env file, you can directly replace the MongoDB connection URI in the server.js file.

Open the server.js file and review the code to ensure it meets your requirements. You can customize the API routes and functionality as needed.

Start the Node.js application with the following command:


npm run dev
This command uses nodemon to automatically restart the server when code changes are detected.

Once the server is running, you should see output in the terminal indicating that the app is running and connected to MongoDB:


[nodemon] starting `node server.js`
App is running
Connected to MongoDB

Using the API
You can use Thunder Client in VSCode or any API testing tool of your choice to interact with the API endpoints. Here are some example requests:

GET Request: Retrieve a list of all tasks.
http
GET http://localhost:3000/tasks


POST Request: Create a new task. Provide a JSON body with title and description fields.
http
POST http://localhost:3000/task
Content-Type: application/json
{
    "title": "Task Title",
    "description": "Task Description"
}

PUT Request: Update an existing task. Replace :id with the ID of the task you want to update. Provide a JSON body with the fields you want to update.
http
PUT http://localhost:3000/tasks/:id
Content-Type: application/json
{
    "title": "Updated Task Title"
}

GET Request: Retrieve a specific task by replacing :id with the ID of the task.
http
GET http://localhost:3000/tasks/:id


Closing the Application
To stop the Node.js application, press Ctrl+C in the terminal where the app is running.

Notes
Ensure that your MongoDB instance is running and accessible before starting the application.

Be cautious with sensitive information like MongoDB URIs and passwords. Do not share them in public repositories or with unauthorized individuals.

You can customize and expand the API functionality to suit your project's requirements by modifying the server.js file and the taskModel.js file in the models directory.

Feel free to adapt this README.md to your specific project's needs, and don't forget to update it with any additional information or usage instructions as your project evolves.
